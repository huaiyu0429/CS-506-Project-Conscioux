# CS-506-Project-Conscioux Internet Market Research
## Project Goals
Our objective is to locate potential markets for Conscioux by taking insight of people's attitude towards veganism. To be more precise, we are interested in the supply and demand of vegetarian.
## Dataset
The two main datasets we use are the data containing terms "vegan", "weight loss" and "vegetarian" scraped from Twitter and public Yelp dataset. Because the original data containing information about tweets is too large to upload, here we only upload the csv after tidying.Our data file including 4 tweets csv files and 1 state_rank csv for lositic regression. The yelp dataset is too large and we cannot upload it. However, you can download the Yelp public dataset from [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).
## Quick Tour of Repository
There are one final report(pdf), one data file(4 tweets csv, 1 state_rank csv for logsitic regression, 2 json for yelp), 2 html (tweet & yelp heatmap) and 5 ipynb files (tweets colllecting, tweets tidying, tweets analyzing & logistic regression, tweets heatmap, yelp clustering).
## Pre-preparation for running the code
Because the original data containing information about tweets is too large to upload, here we only upload the csv after tidying.
